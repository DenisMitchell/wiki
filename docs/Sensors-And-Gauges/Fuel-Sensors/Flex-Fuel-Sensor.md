# Flex Fuel sensors

Flex fuel sensors measure the amount of alcohol content in the fuel passing through it. The flex fuel sensor has a pre calibrated signal that is sent from the sensor in a 0-5v voltage indicating which amount of alcohol is present. The FOME ECU  has the ability to use this data. The signal circuit carries the ethanol percentage via the frequency signal. 

The normal range of operating frequency is between 50–150 Hz. The microprocessor inside the sensor is capable of a certain amount of self-diagnosis. An output frequency between 180 Hz and 190 Hz indicates that the fuel is contaminated.

In TunerStudio you select which input pin you have used for the signal from the flex fuel sensor. You can view % of content using a gauge in TunerStudio.
