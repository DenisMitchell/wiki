# Electronic Throttle Bias Table

The Electronic TB Bias Table/ETB Bias Curve (Feed Forward) is calculated using the _ETB Target_ value to determine the duty bias. This duty bias is added to the output of the ETB PID loop to arrive at the final ETB duty. Values in this table range from -100% to 100%.
