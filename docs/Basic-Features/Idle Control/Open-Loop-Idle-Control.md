# Open Loop Idle Control and How to Set it  

The open loop idle control is one of the first parameters to set when tuning the idle. It sets the base position of the idle air control valve (IACV) which the closed loop idle control leverages off to achieve finer idle control. The fundamental goal of tuning the open loop idle control is to set the base position such that the engine rests at the target idle RPM at the desired idle ignition timing angle.

To tune the idle base position, enable the open loop idle and let the car warm up. Adjust the base position slider until the target RPM is close to desired. Take the car for a drive and re-adjust as necessary.
