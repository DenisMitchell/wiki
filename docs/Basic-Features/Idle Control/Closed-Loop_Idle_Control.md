# Closed loop idle control and how to set it up  

Closed loop idle control uses a combination of closed loop timing adjustments and idle air control valve adjustments to achieve a stable idle. Achieving a stable idle can be difficult as it requires tuning two seperate controllers which operate in parallel to control the engine RPM. The best way to achieve a good idle is to use the closed loop idle timing for the larger and quicker corrections with the idle air controller acting to compensate for slower changes.

Before tuning the closed loop idle, you need to have properly tuned the idle VE, idle ignition table and open loop idle control.
