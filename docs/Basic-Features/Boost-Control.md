# Boost Control

Before you start tuning the boost control, it is essential the make sure that you have a safe boost cut pressure set under _Base Engine > Limits and Fallbacks_. Within this menu, it is also recommended to set only fuel to be cut on the RPM limit as cutting fuel and spark can lead to excess fuel igniting inside the turbine housing causing excess wear to the turbo.

## Methods of Boost Control

Manual boost tees are outdated, So what are the alternatives?

### Three Port Boost Control Solenoid

A three port boost control solenoid works by quickly alternating between diverting boost pressure to atmosphere and to the wastegate. By adjusting the duty cycle or time spent diverting air to atmosphere, the solenoid effectively changes the boost pressure that the wastegate sees allowing it to stay closed for up to three times the wastegate spring pressure.

For most vehicles, this is the most common method of electronic boost control as it it cheap, can be easily plumbed into most turbos and for the most part does a good job of controlling the boost.
