# Air Fuel Ratio 

What is AFR? Air fuel ratio or AFR refers to the ratio of 

## Why AFR Matters 

AFR can impact many factors of how the engine runs including its power, fuel economy, knock threshold, exhaust gas temperature and emissions.


## What is Lambda and Why it is a Superior Metric  

Lambda is an alternative method of measuring the combustion efficiency of an engine. There are multiple reasons why it is preferred over AFR but mostly, it is recommended as it is easier to comprehend and tune with. For example, the ideal or stoichiometric AFR for regular petrol is 14.7 (14.7 parts air to 1 part fuel) which corresponds with a lambda of 1. If a car is running 10% lean, the AFR would be 16.17 and lambda would be 1.1. If the car is 10% rich, AFR would be 13.36 and lambda would be 0.9. Looking at lambda, it is instantly obvious what percentage rich or lean the engine is running but with AFR, it requires more effort.

Lambda represents the percentage of air in the combustion chamber compared to the amount needed for ideal or stoichiometric combustion to occur. 

lambda is consistent across all types of fuels

## AFR Targets - When to Run Rich, Lean and Stoich  

Reference the operating conditions table for lambda targets

The idea AFR targets will vary for every engine however there are guidelines for what the targets should be for each operating zone of the engine. These targets will be represented on a lambda target table or map with RPM on the X-axis, mass air pressure (MAP) on the Y-axis and lambda on the Z-axis. This table can be broken down into several zones.

### Idle, Cruising and Engine Braking

### High Load Naturally Aspirated/Boost Transition Zone

### Medium and High Boost Zones

### Engine Start

### Unused Zones

## AFR For Different Fuels

Fundamentally, an oxygen sensor works in lambda. It measures the oxygen content in the exhaust relative to the open air and outputs a voltage which the ECU or wideband controller can directly convert to lambda. The ECU then converts this to AFR if required by multiplying the lambda by the stoichiometric value of the fuel (typically 14.7 for unleaded). Regardless of the fuel, the oxygen sensor will read the same lambda for any fuel that is burning at its stoichiometric point. A table is shown below comparing the stoichiometric AFR values of common fuels. https://ftyracing.com/tech/lambda-afr-table/
