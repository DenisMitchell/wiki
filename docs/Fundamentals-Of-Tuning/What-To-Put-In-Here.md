# What to put into this section  

use this folder for covering the overall topics of why things are needed, this is the place to talk about things like why an engine needs certian AFRs, why timing needs to be reduced, what is knock, why do you need to add fuel on acceleration etc  

Leave the details of how FOME works for each feature to the specific pages, when relevent we can link the firmware specific page and visavis, keep this and overview as a nuggets intro area  

This can likely kill any dumb questions at source and prevent many user issues down the line
