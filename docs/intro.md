# Welcome to FOME

Fome is a new project intending to deliver a user focused high feature ECU with open source hardware options and open firmware that give control back to the user, owner and driver.  

As there are many complicated topics to cover we recommend that you start with the topics in the "intro" section to the left.  
The first page to view should probably be the FOME overview.  

## Index

### Intro - Start here  

- Tips and Tricks  
- First Checks, enabling and loading firmware  
- Performing a safe first start  
- Guide to ETB and VVT PIDs  
- How to setup a board for first use  
- How to test inputs and outputs  
- FOME Overview
