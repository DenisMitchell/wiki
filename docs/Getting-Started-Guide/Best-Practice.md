# Tips and Tricks  

## Power cycle ECU  
Should be done after any change that is not to a tuning table 

## Always have a main relay  
And wire that relay correctly  

## Why do I have XYZ error?  
Check error code and compare to this list (grab list out of firmware)  

## Table Axis  
Make sure these are always numerically ascending (i.e. 1, 2 ,3 not 1, 1, 3, or 1, 3, 2.)
